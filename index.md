# What is LightFlower?
Do you want to have a unique décorative vase? Choose the exact dimensions, the color, the shape?
No?
Then you probably want to have unique decorative lanterns for your led lighting chain?
In either case, this project got you covered!
# How doeas it work?
It's a Blender script that will create a vase or a lantern depending on the setting. The script is based on sine fonctions ti give the vase or lantern it's distinctive shape.

You will provide the settings, run the script, export the STL. Voilà, a file ready to slice and print!
# Blender? No way I'm using this extra complicated software!
I hear you. However the you dont need to know how blender works. The script does everything. You will need to open the blender file, then export as a STL file.
# I'm still not comfortable doing that
I have uploaded on Thingyverse many of my favorite designs. You can use and resize to your need in your favorite slicer.
# What material do you use?
For vases, I used many type of PLA. I printed some in vase mode in CURA and it works well. The vases are solid enough for most decorative uses. Everything worked well.

For lanterns, transparent PLA worked well. I printed them solid. I tried Orange, Red and Green filament. The orange is perfect. The red is a little bit too dark and the green one is too light. Overall they work well together.
